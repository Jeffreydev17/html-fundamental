            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
             <p>TechCon began as a small technical training and industry meetup in the 1990s, created to bring engineers, technicians, and technology professionals together for hands-on learning. Early TechCon events were simple: printed brochures, small workshops, and vendor tables showing new equipment and tools.
            </p>
            <p>As technology industries expanded in the 2000s, TechCon evolved into a larger, more structured conference format. Different sectors such as power systems, software development, electronics, and radio engineering began using the TechCon name for their own specialized events. This is why today there are multiple “TechCon” conferences worldwide, each focused on a different part of the tech world.</p>
